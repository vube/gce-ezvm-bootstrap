# Update the GCE metadata to remove any of the following keys that may exist or not:
#   ezvm-updates
#   startup-script
#   startup-script-url
#
# If we have previously set startup-script-url to be the ezvm-bootstrap,
# then that means on every reboot we'll bootstrap again, which is probably
# not what you want.  So run this to unset it so reboot works the way it
# normally does, without a rerun of the bootstrap.
#
# Any existing setting for startup-script (embedded script) is also considered
# to be desired only once, and is removed.
